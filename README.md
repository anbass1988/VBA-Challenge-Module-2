# VBA-Challenge-Module-2
This is for SMU Data Science Boot Camp Module 2 challenge 
I looked at alot of Youtube videos relating to "stock data" and finding the "ticker" symbol to be able te to do the majaority of the VBA scripting. 
The youtube video that really helped me out was the youtube videos on "Real Time Stock Price Fetching and Analyzing in Excel Using VBA Macro" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3nPPmfvTsA) and VBA Multi Year Stock Data Script (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLyYhBhKh5w). 
I was able to combine both techniques from the tutorials to create the VBA scripts.
As I ran into errors, I used Co-pilot and the XPert Leraning assistance to help me find discrepancies as I was running into errors as I woorking through the macros.
